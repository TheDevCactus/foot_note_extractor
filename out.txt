                      SHREK
          Once upon a time there was a lovely 
          princess. But she had an enchantment 
          upon her of a fearful sort which could 
          only be broken by love's first kiss. 
          She was locked away in a castle guarded 
          by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. 
          Many brave knights had attempted to 
          free her from this dreadful prison, 
          but non prevailed. She waited in the 
          dragon's keep in the highest room of 
          the tallest tower for her true love 
          and true love's first kiss. ^1 
          Like that's ever gonna happen. What 
          a load of - ^2

day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go

NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOME

                      MAN1
          Think it's in there?

                      MAN2
          All right. Let's get it!

                      MAN1
          Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that 
          thing can do to you?

                      MAN3
          Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's 
          bread.

Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.

                      SHREK
          Yes, well, actually, that would be a 
          giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. 
          They'll make a suit from your freshly 
          peeled skin.

                      MEN
          No!

                      SHREK
          They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the 
          jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's 
          quite good on toast.

                      MAN1
          Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! 
          ^3

Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The 
men shrink back away from him.

FN-3:waves the torch at Shrek.

 Shrek roars very loudly and long 
and his breath extinguishes ^4 all the remaining torches until the 
men are in the dark.


FN-4:what a great word.
